I had warnings with my for loops because I initialized the loop counter as an integer. i instead initialized it as size_t instead.

When echo %errorlevel% is run the value returned is 0 determining success of the program run.

I also ran "Lab1.exe Test.txt" under the Debug directory where I house a Test.txt file to parse the strings for words and integer values.

My program also as I noticed prints the maximum value of an int when a value above the max is found in the .txt file

My program also returns a 0 for success when a string is found without numeric values in it
